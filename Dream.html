<h1>Career</h1>
<hr />
<h2><p>My interest in computers started with video games when I was a little kid. 
    I was interested in how a machine, made only of some metals was able to do so many amazing things such as displaying videos, running games, and other applications, and delivering an unlimited amount of information via the internet. 
    Throughout high school, although I wondered how computers worked behind the scenes, I haven 't found many possibilities to explore these ways. 
    My love towards mathematics throughout primary and high school and interest in computers made my choice of picking computer engineering as my major a very easy task.
     Later, in the university, I have found mathematics and theoretical computer science courses especially interesting to me. 
    I have tried to grasp the concepts presented in these courses with great effort and enjoyed thinking about the world using them.</p> </h2>
